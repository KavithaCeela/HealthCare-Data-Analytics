## Introduction:

Healthcare organizations face increasing pressure to enhance patient care outcomes and improve overall care quality. This challenge presents an opportunity to leverage data analytics to extract valuable insights and enhance care quality. Healthcare analytics involves the use of quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze data, identifying trends and patterns. A key performance metric in healthcare management is a patient's length of stay (LOS). Accurately predicting LOS can help hospitals optimize treatment plans, reduce infection rates, and improve resource management.

## Project Highlights:

The project analyzed hospital admission data to predict the patient's Length of Stay at the time of admission, enabling hospitals to optimize resources and improve operations. Three models were built in Python to predict LOS:

- **Naive Bayes:** A supervised algorithm with an accuracy of 34.55%.
- **XGBoost:** An ensemble method with an accuracy of 43.05%.
- **Dense Neural Network:** A 6-layer network yielding an accuracy of 42.5%.
